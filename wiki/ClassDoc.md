#### class based view: It provides
+ Code reusability 
+ Project development efficiency 
+ time cost savings

####APIView: in this
+ Manually we check for the availability of ids
+ Manually we have to serialize the data by passing into ModelSerializer class
  which is just like ModelForm in django
+ Manually we have to validate the data and save after validation
+ Manually we have to sent response with status code 
+ Here also we are depending somewhat on functions based views
